Initial schematic and gerbers for a Gotek(?) compatible with an Artery AT32F435RGT7 chip and a 26 Pin FFC connector.
Used SFRKC30.AT4.35 PCB for most of the schematic and layout but used SFRC2D.B PCB for the 26 Pin FFC connections.
Used photographs and a multimeter along with removing U1 and U3 on the SFRKC30.AT4.35 to get to the traces underneath.
Where possible I followed the original PCB routing of the SFRKC30.AT4.35 but Kicad has some different rules for trace widths (between pins 5&6 of U8 which isn't fitted).
